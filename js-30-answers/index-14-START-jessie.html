    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log('log', team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'lux';
    console.log('log', team, players); // team : a **reference** to the original array

    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log('log', team2);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log('log', team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // 
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: ' Jessie Willms ',
        age: 90
    }

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // 
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log('log', cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // 
    const wes = {
        name: 'Jessie',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            tw: 'jessiewill',
            fb: 'jessiewill_fb'
        }
    };
    console.clear();
    console.log('log', wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
